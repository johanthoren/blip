# Changelog

## 2.1.6 — 2026-09-01

- **Duplicate toasts fixed.** The bridge now emits each message's ROWID and
  the toast key no longer includes the text: Messages can land a row before
  its decoded body, and a timestamp slightly ahead of the Linux clock kept
  the message above the watermark, so the same message toasted twice.

## 2.1.1 – 2.1.4 — 2026-09-01

- **Links open and come to the front.** Clicks were reaching `xdg-open`
  all along; Omarchy's `focus_on_activate=false` left the tab on the
  browser's workspace. Blip now focuses the browser after opening. (2.1.4)
- **Text selection + Ctrl+C in bubbles** — the conversation Flickable was
  grabbing every drag. (2.1.1)
- **Contact names regression** — one person across several Contacts
  sources ("Rob" / "Robert") is not a collision. (2.1.2)
- Repo scrubbed of maintainer machine names, a real group name, absolute
  paths. (2.1.3)
- README Install rewritten around `omarchy plugin add … --enable`, with
  notes for humans and for AI agents; `AGENTS.md` added. (2.1.4)

## 2.1.0 — 2026-09-01 — war room

Ten expert-lens reviewers swept the repo after the DHH retweet; 114
findings, the clear ones fixed here, the rest on the roadmap.

**Fixed — correctness**
- Attachment-cache eviction had silently never run since 1.9.4 (a missing
  `statSync` import threw inside the LRU). 500 MB cap is real again.
- A DM thread admitted that person's messages from *group* chats.
- Catch-up fetches could exceed Bun's default 1 MB `spawnSync` buffer and
  fail sticky; all bridge calls now allow 64 MB.
- A timed-out `imsg` (Mac asleep behind a live ssh mux) read as a bridge
  bug; it now reads as "Mac asleep" and greys the icon.
- Bridge errors show the *last* stderr line (Python puts the cause last),
  not "Traceback (most recent call last):".
- `state.json` is fsync'd before rename (a power cut no longer resets every
  read mark). Cache temp names carry entropy (no EEXIST after pid reuse).
- Link cards: `$null` titles, URLs with `(…)` (Wikipedia), and userinfo
  host-spoofing handled. Inline-reply snippets respect Recently Deleted.
- macOS 12 and earlier: `imsg` no longer dies on the missing
  Recently-Deleted table.
- Avatar initials for whitespace-only names; non-ASCII attachment names
  survive sanitizing; sent files keep their extension.
- `wait_for_copy` matches only attachment rows newer than the send
  (same-name re-sends no longer confuse it); a send whose copy was never
  observed is kept in `~/.blip/sent` instead of deleted an hour later.

**Fixed — security / privacy**
- File-send captions no longer appear in any process's argv
  (`--caption-stdin`). A cut ssh stream can no longer deliver a truncated
  file (`--file-bytes N` is enforced on the Mac).
- Cache file extensions follow the gated MIME type, not the sender's
  filename (`xdg-open` dispatches on extension).
- `tcc-check` removed from the confined key's allowlist.
- `blip-setup` no longer `source`s `bridge.conf`, no longer echoes a message
  body into the terminal, guards the `authorized_keys` append with a
  newline, keeps a hand-set `automation=` on re-run, drops the ssh master
  before re-checking grants, and names a missing Xcode CLT instead of
  misdiagnosing Full Disk Access. `install.sh` fails loudly on the CLT stub.
- Consent banner prints only on a TTY (recipients no longer reach journald).
- A real phone number and email were removed from a public test fixture.
- Transient bridge failures no longer write a 7-day "no photo" marker.

**Changed**
- Users' dashes are sent as typed (`--keep-dashes` everywhere).
- `xdg-open` and the window-state writer run detached (a blocking handler
  or a mid-write hide could swallow later clicks / the hidden state).
- IPC `compose` refuses when the popout is closed.
- The shim's offline message includes the ssh reason.
- `sync-bridge.sh` stages upstream copies beside locally-modified tools
  instead of overwriting them.
- Tests are isolated from the developer's real caches (`bunfig.toml`
  preload sets `XDG_CACHE_HOME`).

## 2.0.4 — 2026-09-01

**Fixed**
- `blip-check` probed a single, unordered Contacts source; a stale CardDAV
  `.abcddb` sorting first produced a false "contacts ❌ — grant Full Disk
  Access" during `blip-setup` even though contacts and avatars worked. It now
  probes every source like the `contacts` tool does and fails only when none
  opens. First outside contribution — **@jethrojones** (#2). Thank you.

**Repo**
- CI on every push and PR (bun test, Mac tools byte-compile, shellcheck),
  CONTRIBUTING, issue/PR templates, security policy, GitHub Releases.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-08-31

The "complete for Fred" release: everything on the roadmap that makes Blip
feel like Messages, plus the hardening a stranger needs.

**Added**
- Contact photos in the sidebar (`imsg avatar` streams the Contacts
  thumbnail; cached 7 days under `~/.cache/blip/avatars`, negative-cached).
- Rich-link cards: URL messages render title / summary / preview image /
  host, click opens the link; a message that is only the URL shows just the card.
- Unread count in the app window title (`Blip (3)`).
- App window: real gutters, no hero chip, looser sidebar (1.9.3, 1.10.1).
- Dedicated ssh key confined on the Mac to the five bridge tools
  (`blip-dispatch`), with its own ControlMaster socket (1.10.0).
- `automation=` switch in `bridge.conf` gating IPC send/read (1.10.0).
- `blip-check` on the Mac + honest failure states in the panel (1.9.0).
- Sent files are kept in `~/.blip/sent` so your own photos stay showable (1.11.0).

**Security / privacy** (Codex audit, `docs/SECURITY.md`)
- Message text never travels in argv on either machine (`--text-stdin`,
  `--text-stdin-bytes`, `osascript` script on stdin) (1.9.4, 1.11.0).
- `bridge.conf` is parsed, never sourced; host validated; `ssh --` (1.9.4).
- Only media/pdf/text attachments reach `xdg-open`; auto-fetch has a hard
  transfer cap; cache refuses symlinks; catch-up fetch bounded (1.9.4).
- Contact names keyed by the last ten digits never pick the wrong person (1.9.4).

**Fixed**
- SUPER+M dying after every plugin update: Omarchy hot-reload leaves the
  old widget answering `qs ipc` (reported upstream, omacom/omarchy#9533);
  the keybind now decides from Hyprland's client list (1.10.1).
- A hidden FloatingWindow is recreated, never re-shown (Quickshell never
  re-maps it) (1.8.3, 1.10.1).
- Four QML-invariant tests had silently failed since 1.8.0 (1.11.0).

## 1.0.0 → 1.8.x — 2026-08-31

Attachments in and out, tapbacks, read receipts, inline replies, edits,
search, new-conversation composer, reply-from-toast, real-time push, the
app window, one-source bridge (`bridge/`, `blip-setup`), failed-delivery
flags, scroll that works. See `git log` — every commit carries the story.
